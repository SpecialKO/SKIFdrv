SKIF Driver Manager (SKIFdrv)
=======

Service hosts for SKIF to hold 32-bit and 64-bit global injection service.

Can be launched directly and will locate and use `SpecialK[32|64].dll` files automatically provided they either exist in the working directory or its parent folder.

Used by SKIF to hold the global injection service in an easy-to-locate process.
